Owning a license plate in Shanghai is huge asset to the few upper class citizens that can afford it. The due process of registering for a license plate in China is not as easy and by all means more expensive as it is in the USA. In New York, the lisense plate fee is a mere $25.00.(1) Add another $50 for the title registration and you could theoretically walk away with a newly registered plate for $75 and a minor headache (expect one every time at the DMV).  

In this mini-project, I hope to shed some light on the cost of a license plate in Shanghai and why it costs as much as it does. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle looking at the data points from Shanghai's license auction system (more on this in a second) from Jan 2002-Jan 2019. The cost is in CNY and assumes the license type is for a standard non-electric passenger model car.

This project is just one component of a larger project I hope to complete comparing and contrasting the entire cost of driving (a legally, properly registered car) in different cities across the world.

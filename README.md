# SGH_plates

Owning a license plate in Shanghai is huge asset to the few upper class citizens that can afford it. The due process of registering for a license plate in China is not as easy and by all means more expensive as it is in the USA. Tale New York, where the lisense plate fee for a new car is $25.00.(1) Add another $50 for the title registration and you could theoretically walk away with a newly registered plate for $75 and a minor headache (expect one every time at the DMV).  

In this mini-project, I hope to shed some light on the Shanghai license plate auction process, as well and why the license alone can cost up to the price of a new car. The dataset can be found on Kaggle which logs statistics from Jan 2002-Jan 2019.(2) A 17 year timeine of the data allows to see obvious trends. This data is the cost of a standard no non-electric passenger model car (not including electric vehicles). 

This project is one component of a larger project I hope to complete comparing the cost of driving in different cities around the world in the future.

# A little background 

The license plate you apply for is more restrictive of in China than in the USA. One major being the difference being the type of license you have determines where in the city you are allowed to drive. For example, a person with a license registered in Beijing would not be allowed to drive on the streets in Shanghai. The information provided on the license plate allows people to know where they are and aren't allowed to dirve. The format of a license plate in China is as follows：沪A.73B28. The first and only Chinese character determines the city/province where the driver could drive. In this example, the character 沪 (hu4) represents licenses registered in Shanghai. The second letter outlays a more specific area the driver is permitted to drive in. Going along with our example, in Shanghai the letters A-B, D-H, and J-N grant the driver to drive in urban/suburban areas while a C letter license is only allowed to drive in the suburbs and not in Shanghai's city center.(3) Major cities in China follow this aproach with some variation in leter meaning. For For registrants outside of major cities, there is a general province wide character. Sorry, no cross China roadtrips happening with license rules like this in place.
